# ion Learning Coding Exercise
This exercise is aimed at showing off your skills and to provide points of discussion for the next interview stage (the technical call). Due to time limitation on the exercise, it is important to show off known practices and code, and if required, add some extra comments to explain how the code would have been developed further. The time limit will also be used as an understanding of time management and should therefore be followed as intendend.

## Problem

We want you to create a concurrency conversion app using the [SWOP API](https://swop.cx/documentation/common). This application will allow you to select an input currency and see the exchange rate for a specified amount across the selected output currencies, e.g. what is 5 USD in EUR and GBP? This should showcase your ability to build Vue frontends and your best attempt at design, but also demonstrate your ability to build APIs with PHP.

## Requirements

* As a user, I should be able to persist my results to a database and access by my email address. Do not build auth for the persistence. Pick a naive solution and explain your choice.
* As a user, I should be able to submit a value for the amount I want to convert.
* As a user, I should see a list of currencies that I can convert my money from.
* As a user when I submit my selections, I should see the different output exchange rates with information that indicates what my best exchange rate is.
* As a user, I should be able to select 1 or more output currencies.

## Rules
- Unless told otherwise, we assume that all the code pushed has been made by yourself.
- You may use any open source libraries, but be prepared to explain what they are and how they work.
- Use your choice of Vue 2 or Vue 3
- jQuery CANNOT be used within the application
- The backend should be built using Laravel.
- The exercise should be pushed up on a GitHub repository. Please do not include "ion" anywhere in the repository.
- There is freedom to showcase any of your skills, even if it is not mentioned in the following "requirements".
- The stories are randomly sorted and need to be prioritized before starting
- Please track your time per task

# Submission
* Please include instructions for installing your repoistory and running it for testing.
